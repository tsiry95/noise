/**
 * An Icon Object
 *
 * Icon objects point to icon files or generic icon names. The API provides convenience
 * methods for rendering the icon to a {@link Gdk.Pixbuf} image or {@link Gtk.Image} widgets.
 *
 * When an icon points to an absolute path (e.g. /usr/share/noise/icons/default-cover-art.png),
 * the image is loaded from that specific file and not from any icon theme. Otherwise, the icon
 * is searched in the available icon themes. Please note though that it's not necessary to pass
 * an absolute path in order to get backup icon (i.e. icons shipped along with the application)
 * support, since the application's icon path is also queried when looking up for named icons,
 * which means that shipping a backup icon file and installing it to a sub-directory named "hicolor"
 * is enough for making sure that the icon will always be available/found. For instance:
 *
 * {{{
 * // To provide a fallback, simply install a fallback icon. e.g. ${NOISE_ICON_DIR}/hicolor/starred.svg
 * var icon = new Noise.Icon ("starred");
 *
 * // Supposing the icon was not found in any icon theme, the fallback icon file will be used instead,
 * // so this operation will never fail.
 * icon.render (Gtk.IconSize.MENU);
 * }}}
 *
 * This class is actually a wrapper around {@link GLib.Icon} that allows easy backup-icon management.
